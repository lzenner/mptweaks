------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This mod is compatible with all IE games except the first component cannot be installed on IWD2.

The MPTweaks mod fixes a couple of issues in multiplayer sessions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Take it outside
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Up to 5 mobs in combat might follow a group member outside through a door.  
This is a one-way trip only and is dependent upon timing so it may take more than one attempt to lure them out.
The script is only applied to indoor areas whose travel regions are usable by NPCs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pause game when NPCs turn hostile during dialogue
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pause is not instant.
There has to be a period of time between the dialogue ending and the game being paused when in multiplayer.
The script waits the shortest amount of time possible before pausing the game.
The functionality is tied to the player's AI.  If AI is turned off, the game won't pause.

COMPATABIITY NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are no known compatibility issues at this time

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation using Project Infinity (https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/74335/project-infinity-mod-manager-for-baldurs-gate-icewind-dale-planescape-torment-and-eet) will ensure this and other mods are installed in the correct order. Generally though, the mod should be installed after all dialogue and areas have been added and can safely be added after EET_end.

NOTE: If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting a new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables. 

When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.

General (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)

Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory. 

Windows
On successful extraction, there should be a mptweaks folder and a setup-mptweaks.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-mptweaks.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-mptweaks.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Mac OS X
The mod is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, extract the mod archive, then copy of the contents of the folder into your game folder (the folder which contains the CHITIN.KEY file). If properly extracted, you should have an "mptweaks" folder, setup-mptweaks, and setup-mptweaks.command in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-mptweaks.command and follow the instructions on screen.

Linux
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your EET installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already run it once in the same directory. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safest bet.
Run WeInstall mptweaks in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. 

If you have installation problems or encounter any bugs, please post your bug report in the forum thread: https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/32809-multiplayer-tweaks-fixes-for-multiplayer-sessions/
